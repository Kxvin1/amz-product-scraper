### How to use:

###### [FAST] Option 1: Grabs asins only and exports to csv under 1 column
```bash
run the 'asin_only_scraper.py' script
```

###### [SLOW] Option 2: Grabs asin, price, total review rating, number of reviews and then export to csv under 5 columns (ASIN, Title, Price, Rating, Reviews)
```bash
run the 'complete_scraper.py' script
```

---

### Todo:

###### 1. Add both functionalities to JARVIS (my discord bot)
###### 2. Speed up scraping (one of these?: multithreading, multiprocessing, asyncio)
